            <h2>What is Facilities Maintenance Work?</h2>
            <p><strong>Commercial service work for buildings and properties.</strong> This is ongoing electrical maintenance, repairs, and emergency service for commercial properties, NOT one-time construction projects.</p>

            <h3>Types of Facilities Maintenance Work:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emergency Service Calls:</strong> Power outages, electrical failures, safety hazards</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive Maintenance:</strong> Regular inspections, testing, scheduled maintenance</li>
                <li><strong>Repair Work:</strong> Fixing broken panels, outlets, lighting, circuits</li>
                <li><strong>Code Compliance:</strong> Bringing systems up to code, passing inspections</li>
                <li><strong>Tenant Service:</strong> Electrical work for individual tenants in buildings</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> Panel replacements, lighting retrofits, system improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Key Difference:</strong> Facilities maintenance is ONGOING SERVICE, not project-based construction. You're building long-term relationships and recurring revenue, not bidding one-off jobs.

            <h2>Why They Should Choose Shaffer Construction</h2>

            <h3>1. We Actually Answer the Phone</h3>
            <div class="talking-points">
                <strong>The stat:</strong> 78% of leads go to the first contractor who responds.<br>
                <strong>What to say:</strong> "When you call us, we answer. Not voicemail, not 'we'll call you back in 3 days.' Real people, real answers, right away. For emergencies, we're on-site within 30-60 minutes."
            </div>

            <h3>2. Small Team = Personal Service</h3>
            <div class="talking-points">
                <strong>What to say:</strong> "Our team is 4 electricians. That means when you call, you get the same people every time. We're not juggling 500 properties. You get personal attention and we actually remember your buildings."
            </div>

            <h3>3. We Know LA Inside and Out</h3>
            <div class="talking-points">
                <strong>What to say:</strong> "We're LA-based and know the permitting, inspectors, and local codes. No travel fees, no 'we'll have to check on that.' We know this market."
            </div>

            <h3>4. Licensed for More Than Just Electrical</h3>
            <div class="talking-points">
                <strong>What to say:</strong> "We're licensed C-10, B, and A. That means we can handle broader scopes than typical electricians. If you need general building work or infrastructure, we can do it. One contractor, more capabilities."
            </div>

            <h3>5. Proven Track Record</h3>
            <div class="talking-points">
                <strong>What to say:</strong> "We've been serving commercial properties since 2014. We work with established clients like Stratus, PVC, and Brite Construction. Happy to provide references."

What makes us different:

First, we actually answer the phone. I know that sounds basic, but 78% of property managers say they can't get contractors to call back. We answer 24/7.

Second, our team is small, just 4 electricians. That's an advantage for you because you get the same people every time, not random crews. We remember your buildings and your systems.

Third, we're LA-based and know the permitting, codes, and inspectors. No learning curve, no travel fees.

Fourth, we're licensed C-10, B, and A, which gives us broader capabilities than typical electricians.

We work with property managers and facilities companies who need reliable electrical support they can count on. We offer both on-call service and preventive maintenance contracts with predictable monthly pricing.

Would it make sense to discuss your properties and electrical needs?</div>

                <li>"How often do electrical issues come up?" (understand frequency)</li>
                <li>"Do you have a regular electrician or call different people each time?" (understand relationship status)</li>
                <li>"What's most important to you in an electrical contractor?" (understand priorities)</li>
                <li>"Are you required to have preventive maintenance programs for insurance or compliance?" (NFPA 70B)</li>
                <li>"How old are the electrical systems in your buildings?" (assess needs)</li>

            <h2>The NFPA 70B Compliance Opportunity</h2>

            <div class="urgency-box">
                <h3>🚨 NEW REQUIREMENT (2023): NFPA 70B Now MANDATORY</h3>
                <p><strong>What changed:</strong> As of 2023, NFPA 70B requires documented electrical maintenance plans for commercial buildings.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Insurance companies are now checking compliance. Buildings without maintenance plans risk coverage issues.</p>
                <p><strong>The opportunity:</strong> Most property managers don't know about this yet. YOU can educate them and provide the solution.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Use This in Your Pitch:</h3>
            <div class="script-box">"Are you aware of the new NFPA 70B requirements that went into effect in 2023? It now REQUIRES documented electrical maintenance plans for commercial buildings.

Insurance companies are starting to check compliance. Properties without documented maintenance programs could face coverage issues.

Our preventive maintenance contracts ensure you're compliant and have all the documentation you need. We handle inspections, testing, maintenance, and provide detailed reports that satisfy NFPA 70B requirements.

Would it make sense to discuss a maintenance program for your properties?"</div>

            <h3>Key Stats to Mention:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilities WITHOUT preventive maintenance have 3x more electrical equipment damage</li>
                <li>Emergency electrical repairs cost 2-4x more than preventive maintenance</li>
                <li>Average unplanned electrical downtime costs $5,000-$50,000+ depending on facility</li>

            <h2>Common Objections & Responses</h2>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h4>❌ "We already have an electrician"</h4>
                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "That's great you have someone. How's their response time when you have emergencies? Do they answer after hours? A lot of our clients keep their current electrician and use us as backup for emergencies or when they're unavailable. Would that make sense?"
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h4>❌ "We just call someone when we need them"</h4>
                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "I hear that a lot. The challenge is emergency rates are 2-4x higher than preventive maintenance, plus you're scrambling to find someone when you have a crisis. And with the new NFPA 70B requirements, insurance companies want documented maintenance. A service agreement gives you priority response, lower rates, and compliance. Want to see the numbers?"
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h4>❌ "We can't afford a maintenance contract"</h4>
                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Let me ask, what does one electrical emergency cost you? Usually $1,000-$5,000 in repairs, plus downtime costs. Our preventive maintenance contract typically pays for itself by avoiding just one or two emergencies per year. Plus you're compliant with NFPA 70B. It's really insurance against bigger problems."
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h4>❌ "Our systems are pretty new, we don't need maintenance"</h4>
                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Actually, even new systems benefit from regular inspections. Plus, NFPA 70B compliance is required regardless of system age. And building a maintenance history now protects your warranty and adds value. Better to start while everything's working well."
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">

                <div class="solution">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific aspects are you considering? [Listen] How about this: let's start with a one-time inspection of your properties. We'll assess the systems, identify any issues, and show you what a maintenance program would look like. No commitment. Fair?"

                <li><strong>Answer the phone ALWAYS:</strong> This is your #1 differentiator</li>
                <li><strong>Think long-term:</strong> One contract = recurring monthly revenue for years</li>
                <li><strong>Small is an advantage:</strong> Personal service, same people every time</li>
                <li><strong>Track everything:</strong> Every contact, conversation, follow-up in a spreadsheet</li>
                <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Service contracts take time to build trust</li>
