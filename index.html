            <h2>Your Pitch (Memorize This)</h2>

            <h3>30-Second Elevator Pitch</h3>
            <div class="script-box">Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Shaffer Construction. We're a Los Angeles electrical contractor licensed C-10, B, and A, specializing in commercial tenant improvement and facilities maintenance work.

We currently work with contractors like Stratus, PVC, and Brite Construction. Our small team allows us to be nimble and responsive with direct access to ownership.

We're looking to build relationships with quality general contractors in the LA area. Would it make sense to have a brief conversation about your electrical subcontractor needs?</div>

            <h3>2-Minute Full Pitch</h3>
            <div class="script-box">Hi, I'm [Your Name] with Shaffer Construction. We're a licensed electrical contractor based in Los Angeles, and I wanted to introduce our company.

We've been in business since 2014, founded by Mike Shaffer. We're licensed C-10, B, and A, which gives us broader capabilities than most electrical contractors who only have C-10. This means we can handle more complex scopes and even act as GC on electrical-focused projects.

Our team is small, just 4 electricians plus admin, which is actually a big advantage. You get direct access to the owner, fast decision-making without corporate bureaucracy, and personalized attention on every project.

We specialize in commercial tenant improvement work, retail, office, restaurant, medical fit-outs, and facilities maintenance. We currently work with Stratus, PVC, and Brite Construction and can provide references from any of them.

What makes us different:
• Triple licensing (C-10, B, A) vs. just C-10
• Small and nimble, direct owner access
• Deep LA expertise with permitting and codes
• Proven track record with established GCs
• Responsive, we answer calls and respond fast

We're looking to establish relationships with other quality general contractors in LA. Would it make sense to discuss your electrical subcontractor needs and potentially get on your bid list?</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discovery Questions (Ask These)</h2>
            <p>Don't just pitch. Ask questions to understand their needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What types of projects do you typically work on?" (understand their business)</li>
                <li>"How many electrical subcontractors do you currently use?" (understand competition)</li>
                <li>"What's most important to you when selecting an electrical sub?" (understand priorities)</li>
                <li>"What challenges have you had with electrical contractors in the past?" (understand pain points)</li>
                <li>"What's your process for adding contractors to your bid list?" (understand next steps)</li>
                <li>"Do you have any upcoming projects where electrical is a significant scope?" (understand timing)</li>

                <div class="response">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "That's great you have contractors you trust. Many of our best clients came to us initially as a backup resource, for when your main contractor is at capacity, emergencies when they're unavailable, or specialty projects. Would it make sense to get prequalified as a backup option?"
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="objection">

                <div class="response">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Our size is actually an advantage. You get direct access to the owner for fast decisions, personal attention on every project, and we're not juggling hundreds of jobs. Plus, our triple licensing (C-10, B, A) gives us capabilities that larger contractors often don't have."

                <div class="response">
                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Absolutely, I'll send over our company overview, licenses, and references. While I have you though, what types of projects are you typically working on? That helps me send the most relevant information." (Then ask discovery questions)
                </div>

                    <strong>✓ Response:</strong> "Our B and A licenses actually qualify us for larger projects that C-10-only contractors can't touch. We've worked on projects ranging from small service calls to full commercial buildings. What size projects are we talking about?"
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="objection">
