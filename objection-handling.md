## Objection Handling Framework

### The 4-Step Process

1. **Listen and Acknowledge**
   - Let them finish completely
   - Don't interrupt
   - Show you heard them
   - "I understand your concern about..."

2. **Clarify and Isolate**
   - Make sure you understand the real objection
   - "Help me understand, is it the timeline or the budget that's the main concern?"
   - "If we could address the price, is there anything else preventing us from moving forward?"

3. **Respond with Evidence**
   - Address the specific concern
   - Use facts, data, examples
   - Reference similar situations
   - Show how you've solved this before

4. **Confirm and Advance**
   - "Does that address your concern?"
   - "What would you like to do next?"
   - Move the sale forward

## Common Objections and Responses

### 1. "You're too expensive"

**DON'T:**
- Immediately drop your price
- Get defensive
- Disparage cheaper competitors
- Ignore the objection

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "I want to make sure I understand, compared to what are we expensive?"
- "What were you expecting to invest in this project?"
- "Help me understand what's driving the budget concern?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Value Justification**
"I understand price is important. Let me break down where the value comes from:
- Our triple licensing (C-10, B, A) means broader capabilities
- Small team means faster response and personal attention
- LA expertise saves time and money on permitting
- Track record with Stratus, PVC, and Brite Construction shows reliability

The question isn't really about the lowest price, it's about the best value. Would you agree?"

**Option B: Total Cost Perspective**
"I appreciate that initial cost matters. But let's look at total cost:
- Callbacks and fixes cost more in the long run
- Delays cost you money in extended schedules
- Quality work the first time actually saves money
- Our responsiveness prevents costly downtime

What's your experience been with the cheapest bid in the past?"

**Option C: Payment Flexibility**
"Let's talk about what we can do to make this work:
- We can discuss payment terms
- We could phase the work differently
- Are there scope adjustments that would help?
- What budget did you have in mind?"

**Option D: Reframe as Investment**
"I understand the concern about cost. But think of this as an investment, not an expense:
- Reliable electrical infrastructure
- Code compliant work that passes inspection
- Relationship with a responsive contractor
- Peace of mind and reduced downtime

What's the cost of electrical failures or non-compliance to your business?"

---

### 2. "We already have electrical contractors we use"

**DON'T:**
- Say "what's wrong with them?"
- Disparage their current contractor
- Give up immediately
- Be pushy

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "That's great that you have contractors you trust. How's that relationship working for you?"
- "Are they able to handle all your electrical needs?"
- "Do you ever need backup or additional capacity?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Backup Resource**
"It sounds like you have a good relationship, and I respect that. Many of our best clients came to us initially as a backup resource:
- Emergency situations when your main contractor is unavailable
- Overflow work when they're at capacity
- Specialty projects that need our triple licensing
- Second opinion or competitive pricing

Would it make sense to have us prequalified as a backup option?"

**Option B: Different Capabilities**
"That's great you have reliable contractors. Our triple licensing (C-10, B, and A) gives us some unique capabilities:
- Can act as GC on electrical-focused projects
- Infrastructure and civil work qualification
- Broader scope than typical electrical contractors

Are there situations where those capabilities would be valuable?"

**Option C: Start Small**
"I respect established relationships. How about this:
- Start with a small project or service call
- See how we perform
- No long-term commitment
- If we do well, consider us for future work

Would that be a reasonable way to get to know each other?"

**Option D: Stay in Touch**
"I completely understand loyalty to contractors who've served you well. Would it be okay if I:
- Stay in touch periodically
- Keep you updated on our capabilities
- Be available if your needs change or you need additional capacity

People's situations change, and I'd like to be top of mind when they do."

---

### 3. "Can you do it cheaper?"

**DON'T:**
- Immediately reduce price
- Say "let me check with my boss"
- Devalue your own service
- Race to the bottom

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "Help me understand what's driving the need for a lower price?"
- "Is there a specific budget you're working within?"
- "What would need to change to make this work for you?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Scope Adjustment**
"I want to make sure you get what you need within your budget. Let's look at the scope:
- Are there elements we could phase differently?
- Any items we could remove or simplify?
- Different materials or approaches that would work?
- Areas where you could self-perform some work?

Let's find the right balance of scope and budget."

**Option B: Value vs. Price**
"I understand budget constraints. Before we reduce the price, let me make sure you understand what's included:
- [Specific deliverables]
- [Quality standards]
- [Timeline commitments]
- [Warranty and support]

If we reduce the price, we'd need to adjust the scope accordingly. What's most important to you?"

**Option C: Payment Terms**
"Rather than reducing the scope, would different payment terms help?
- Extended payment schedule
- Progress payments
- Net 30 or Net 60 terms
- Splitting into phases

Would that make it more manageable?"

**Option D: Protect Your Value**
"I've given you our best price for the scope we discussed. Our pricing reflects:
- Quality materials and workmanship
- Proper licensing and insurance
- Experienced team
- Responsive service

I can't compromise on those without compromising the results. But I'm happy to help you find ways to make it work, whether that's adjusting scope or payment terms."

---

### 4. "We need it faster than you can deliver"

**DON'T:**
- Promise unrealistic timelines
- Overcommit the team
- Ignore the request
- Say "impossible"

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "Help me understand your timeline needs?"
- "What's driving the urgency?"
- "What happens if we can't meet that timeline?"
- "Is there any flexibility?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Explore Options**
"I understand timeline is critical. Let me see what we can do:
- Could we phase the work differently?
- Are there elements we could prioritize?
- Would additional crew help?
- Can we work nights/weekends if needed?

Let me check our schedule and see what's possible."

**Option B: Honest Assessment**
"I appreciate the urgency. Here's what I can honestly commit to:
- [Realistic timeline based on scope]
- [What we can prioritize]
- [Where we have flexibility]

I'd rather give you a realistic timeline we can meet than promise something and disappoint you. Does that work?"

**Option C: Alternative Solution**
"Given your timeline, let me suggest:
- Phase 1: Critical items completed by [date]
- Phase 2: Remaining work completed by [date]
- This gets you operational faster
- Spreads the investment over time

Would that approach work?"

**Option D: Small Team Advantage**
"Actually, our small team size can be an advantage here:
- Fast decision-making, no bureaucracy
- Direct communication with owners
- Flexible scheduling
- Can mobilize quickly

Let me see what we can do to meet your needs."

---

### 5. "I need to get more bids"

**DON'T:**
- Say "you won't find better"
- Pressure them to decide now
- Give up and wait passively
- Offer unnecessary discounts

**DO:**

**Acknowledge:**
- "Absolutely, getting multiple bids is smart business"
- "I'd do the same thing in your position"
- "Due diligence is important"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Help Them Compare**
"As you're getting other bids, here's what to look for to compare apples to apples:
- Same scope of work
- Similar materials and quality
- Equal licensing and insurance
- Response time commitments
- Warranty terms

I want you to make the best decision, even if it's not us."

**Option B: Highlight Differentiators**
"When you're comparing bids, keep in mind what makes us different:
- Triple licensing (C-10, B, A) vs. C-10 only
- Small team means faster decisions and personal service
- LA expertise saves time and money on permitting
- Proven track record with Stratus, PVC, Brite Construction

Price matters, but so does capability and reliability."

**Option C: Stay Engaged**
"While you're getting other bids:
- I'm available to answer questions
- Can provide additional information
- Happy to clarify any part of our proposal
- Can meet to discuss further

When should I follow up with you?"

**Option D: Build Urgency (If Appropriate)**
"I understand you want to compare options. A couple things to note:
- [Any time-sensitive factors]
- [Material lead times]
- [Schedule availability]
- [Pricing validity period]

When do you expect to make a decision?"

---

### 6. "I need to think about it"

**DON'T:**
- Say "what's there to think about?"
- Get pushy
- Assume they're not interested
- Leave with no next steps

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific aspects do you want to think about?"
- "Is there additional information I can provide to help?"
- "Are there questions I haven't answered?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Uncover the Real Objection**
"I appreciate you want time to think. Often when people say that, there's a specific concern. Is it:
- The price or budget?
- The timeline?
- The scope of work?
- Something else?

I'd rather address it now than have you think about something I could easily clarify."

**Option B: Provide Resources**
"While you're thinking it over, would it help if I provided:
- References you can contact?
- Examples of similar projects?
- More detail on any part of the proposal?
- Answers to specific questions?

What information would be most helpful?"

**Option C: Set a Specific Follow-Up**
"I completely understand. When would be a good time for me to follow up?
- Later this week?
- Early next week?
- Before the end of the month?

Let's put something on the calendar so I don't bug you too early or wait too long."

**Option D: Leave Value**
"While you're considering it, I'll send you:
- [Case study of similar project]
- [Reference contact information]
- [Additional details on X]

These might help with your decision. I'll check back with you on [specific date]."

---

### 7. "We've had bad experiences with small contractors"

**DON'T:**
- Get defensive
- Say they were "bad contractors"
- Make promises you can't keep
- Ignore their concern

**DO:**

**Acknowledge:**
- "I'm sorry you had that experience. That must have been frustrating."
- "I understand why you'd be cautious."
- "Can you tell me what happened?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Address Directly**
"I understand your concern based on past experience. Here's what makes us different:
- Founded in 2014, we've built a sustainable business
- Proper licensing (C-10, B, A) and insurance
- Established relationships with major GCs (Stratus, PVC, Brite Construction)
- Owner (Mike Shaffer) personally involved
- Track record you can verify

Would it help to speak with our current clients about their experience?"

**Option B: Small as Advantage**
"I appreciate your concern. Actually, our size is an advantage in the right ways:
- Direct access to owners for fast decisions
- Personal attention to every project
- Nimble and responsive
- Not stretched thin across dozens of projects

But we're established with proper licensing, insurance, and proven relationships. What specifically are you concerned about?"

**Option C: Prove Stability**
"Let me address that concern with facts:
- In business since 2014
- Active license #994593 in good standing
- Current work with [client names]
- Proper insurance and bonding
- Financial stability (work with Rosenfeld and Bueno for accounting)

What would give you confidence we're reliable?"

**Option D: Start Small, Earn Trust**
"I understand your hesitation. How about this:
- Start with a small project or service call
- See how we perform
- Verify we're reliable and professional
- Build the relationship from there

We're confident our work will speak for itself. Fair enough?"

---

### 8. "Your proposal doesn't match our budget"

**DON'T:**
- Automatically reduce price
- Assume it's dead
- Get frustrated
- Leave without options

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "Help me understand the gap. What budget did you have in mind?"
- "Is the budget fixed or is there flexibility?"
- "Are there must-haves versus nice-to-haves in the scope?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Scope to Budget**
"Let's work backwards from your budget:
- What can we accomplish for [their budget]?
- What are the highest priorities?
- What could we defer to a future phase?
- Where can we find value engineering opportunities?

Let me put together options that fit your budget while meeting your core needs."

**Option B: Phase the Work**
"If budget is the constraint, let's talk about phasing:
- Phase 1: Critical items [dollar amount]
- Phase 2: Secondary items [dollar amount]
- Phase 3: Nice-to-haves [dollar amount]

This spreads the investment and gets you the most important work done first."

**Option C: Payment Terms**
"Rather than reducing scope, would payment terms help?
- Longer payment period
- Deferred start to align with your budget cycle
- Progress payments over time

The investment is the same, but the cash flow might work better."

**Option D: Value Justification**
"I understand the budget concern. Before we reduce scope, consider:
- Cost of doing it twice if done incorrectly
- Downtime costs if it fails
- Compliance penalties if not code-compliant
- Long-term operating costs

Sometimes the right answer is to find the budget for the full scope. What options do you have for additional budget if needed?"

---

### 9. "We're going with someone else"

**DON'T:**
- Argue with their decision
- Bad mouth the competitor
- Get emotional
- Burn bridges

**DO:**

**Accept Gracefully:**
- "Thank you for considering us and for letting me know"
- "I appreciate the opportunity to bid"
- "Congratulations on your decision"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Learn for Next Time**
"I appreciate you letting me know. To help me improve:
- What was the deciding factor?
- Was there anything we could have done differently?
- Is it primarily price or other factors?
- Any feedback on our proposal or process?

Your input helps me serve future clients better."

**Option B: Stay in Touch**
"I respect your decision. Would it be okay if:
- I stay in touch periodically?
- I'm available if your needs change?
- You keep us in mind for future projects?
- You think of us if the situation changes?

People's circumstances change, and I'd like to work with you in the future."

**Option C: Be a Resource**
"Even though we won't be working together on this project:
- I'm available if questions come up
- Happy to be a second opinion if needed
- Here if the situation changes

I hope the project goes well."

**Option D: Open Door**
"I understand. If anything changes or if issues come up with the current plan:
- We're here and ready to help
- No hard feelings about switching
- Your success is what matters

Please don't hesitate to reach out."

---

### 10. "We need to run this by [someone else]"

**DON'T:**
- Try to go around them
- Pressure them to decide without approval
- Ignore the stakeholder
- Assume it's a stall tactic

**DO:**

**Clarify:**
- "Absolutely, who else needs to be involved?"
- "What information will they need to make a decision?"
- "Would it help if I presented to them directly?"
- "What's their main concern or criteria?"

**Response Options:**

**Option A: Facilitate the Process**
"I want to help make that conversation successful:
- What materials would be helpful for them to review?
- Should I prepare a summary or presentation?
- Would they like to meet with me?
- What questions are they likely to have?

Let's make sure they have everything they need."

**Option B: Understand the Decision Process**
"Help me understand the approval process:
- Who's involved in the final decision?
- What's the timeline for approval?
- What criteria will they use?
- Are there common concerns I should address proactively?

This helps me support you in getting approval."

**Option C: Offer to Present**
"Would it be helpful if I:
- Joined the meeting to present directly?
- Prepared a summary for them?
- Answered their questions?
- Provided additional information?

I'm happy to help get everyone on the same page."

**Option D: Equip Them to Sell Internally**
"Since you'll be presenting this internally, let me make sure you have what you need:
- [Executive summary]
- [Key benefits and ROI]
- [Comparison to alternatives]
- [Answers to likely questions]

What else would help you get approval?"

- Clarify before responding
- "Help me understand..."

### Use Evidence
- Facts and data
- Examples and case studies
- References and testimonials
- Specific details

### Reframe When Appropriate

### Always Maintain the Relationship
- Professional regardless of outcome
- Leave door open for future

---

## Practice Makes Perfect

### Role Play Regularly

## Remember

**Objections Are Actually Buying Signals**

When people object, it means they're engaged and considering. A total lack of objections often means they're not interested. Welcome objections as opportunities to address concerns and build trust.

**Listen First, Then Respond**

The key to handling objections is understanding the real concern. Often the stated objection isn't the real issue. Ask clarifying questions and listen carefully.

**Your Technical Background Is an Asset**

As an electrician, you have credibility. Use your knowledge to address technical concerns with authority. You're not just a salesperson, you're an expert.

**Focus on Building Relationships**

Even if you don't win this project, how you handle objections affects the relationship. Stay professional, be helpful, and leave the door open for future opportunities.
