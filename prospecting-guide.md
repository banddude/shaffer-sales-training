## Overcoming Prospecting Challenges

### "I don't like cold calling"

**Reality:** Most people don't. Do it anyway.

**Strategies:**
- Start with warm leads (referrals)
- Use email first, then follow up by phone
- Treat it like exercise (gets easier with practice)
- Set small goals (5 calls today)
- Celebrate wins (voicemail left counts)

### "I don't know what to say"

**Solution:** Use scripts and practice.

**Practice:**
- Role-play with colleagues
- Record yourself
- Start with less important prospects
- Refine based on responses
- Get comfortable with your pitch

### "People don't respond"

**Reality:** Most won't. It's a numbers game.

**Strategies:**
- Multiple touches (email, call, LinkedIn, mail)
- Vary your approach and timing
- Add value in each touch
- Be persistent but not annoying
- Track response rates and improve

### "I'm too busy with current work"

**Reality:** That's when prospecting matters most.

**Solution:**
- Block time (non-negotiable)
- Even 30 minutes counts
- Pipeline builds for when work slows
- Delegate other tasks if possible

### "I get rejected a lot"

**Reality:** Yes, you will. It's normal.

**Mindset Shifts:**
- "No" often means "not right now"
- Rejection isn't personal
- Each "no" gets you closer to "yes"
- Track and celebrate activities, not just wins
- Learn from each interaction

## Remember

**Prospecting is Not Optional**

It's the most important activity for long-term success. Without prospecting, your pipeline dries up and revenue becomes unpredictable.

**Consistency is Key**

Daily prospecting creates a steady flow of opportunities. Block the time and protect it.

**Relationships Matter**

You're not just finding project opportunities, you're building a network of relationships that will sustain your career.

**Your Technical Background is an Advantage**

As an electrician, you have credibility that pure salespeople don't. Use it in your prospecting conversations.

**Track and Improve**

Measure your activities and results. Double down on what works and adjust what doesn't.
