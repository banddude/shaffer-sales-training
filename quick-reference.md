You're selling partnerships, reliability, and peace of mind. General contractors and facilities managers want electrical subcontractors they can trust to:
- Show up when promised
- Do quality work
- Communicate clearly
- Solve problems
- Be responsive
- Work as a team

**Your Technical Background Is an Advantage**

You understand the work, speak the language, and have credibility that pure sales reps don't have. Use it.

**Small Is an Advantage**

Don't apologize for team size. Position it as nimble, responsive, personal service with direct access to owners.

**Every Interaction Matters**

From first email to project completion, you're building a reputation. Make every interaction professional, responsive, and valuable.
