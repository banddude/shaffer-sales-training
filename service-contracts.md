## Selling Service Contracts

### Discovery Questions

**Understand Their Situation:**
- "How many properties/facilities do you manage?"
- "What electrical systems do you have? (age, type, critical systems?)"
- "How do you currently handle electrical maintenance?"
- "Have you had electrical failures or emergencies? What did they cost?"
- "Are you required to maintain NFPA 70B compliance?"
- "What are your insurance requirements for electrical maintenance?"
- "How predictable is your electrical maintenance budget?"
- "What keeps you up at night about your electrical systems?"

### Value Proposition

**NFPA 70B Compliance:**
"As of 2023, NFPA 70B requires documented electrical maintenance plans for all commercial buildings. Many insurance companies are now requiring this compliance. Our preventive maintenance contract ensures you meet these requirements and have the documentation to prove it."

**Downtime Prevention:**
"Facilities without preventive electrical maintenance experience 3x more equipment damage and failures. The cost of one significant electrical failure often exceeds years of preventive maintenance. Our program helps you avoid these costly surprises."

**Budget Predictability:**
"Instead of unpredictable emergency repair costs that can spike your budget, a maintenance contract gives you fixed, predictable monthly costs. You can budget accurately and avoid surprises."

**Priority Service:**
"When you have an electrical emergency, you need help fast. Our contract customers get priority response, jumping to the front of the queue. You're not competing with one-time callers for our availability."

**Peace of Mind:**
"You have enough to worry about. Let us monitor your electrical systems, catch problems early, and handle issues before they become emergencies. You sleep better knowing experts are watching your infrastructure."

### Overcoming Objections

**"We can't afford it"**

Response: "Let me show you what it costs not to have preventive maintenance:
- Average emergency service call: $500-$2,000
- Average unplanned downtime cost: $5,000-$50,000+ depending on facility
- Cost of NFPA 70B non-compliance: Insurance issues, liability, fines

Our preventive maintenance contract is insurance against these costs. It's not an expense, it's a savings."

**"Our systems are new, we don't need maintenance"**

Response: "Even new systems benefit from regular inspection and testing. Plus:
- Warranty requirements often include proper maintenance
- Early detection prevents small issues becoming big problems
- Compliance requirements apply regardless of system age
- Building a maintenance history now adds value

And new systems are the perfect time to start a program while everything is working well."

**"We'll just call when we need you"**

Response: "Reactive maintenance costs 2-4 times more than preventive maintenance. Here's why:
- Emergency rates vs. scheduled rates
- Downtime costs while waiting for service
- Bigger repairs needed when problems aren't caught early
- No priority response when you do call

The contract pays for itself by avoiding just one or two emergencies per year."

**"We have in-house maintenance"**

Response: "That's great you have maintenance staff. Our contracts often complement in-house teams:
- Specialized electrical expertise they may not have
- Backup when they're unavailable or overwhelmed
- Third-party documentation for compliance and insurance
- Handle complex work beyond their scope
- Free up their time for other priorities

Think of us as an extension of your team, not a replacement."

We're confident you'll see the value once you experience our service."

## Pricing Service Contracts

### Cost-Plus Model

**Calculate Costs:**
- Labor hours per visit × hourly rate
- Travel time
- Materials and supplies
- Administrative time (reporting, coordination)
- Overhead allocation
- Profit margin

**Example for Quarterly PM Contract:**
- 4 site visits/year × 4 hours/visit = 16 hours
- 16 hours × $100/hour labor = $1,600
- Materials and supplies: $200/year
- Administrative (reports, coordination): $400/year
- Total cost: $2,200/year
- + 30% profit margin: $2,860/year
- = $238/month or $715/quarter

### Value-Based Pricing

**What's it Worth to Customer:**
- Cost of one emergency avoided: $1,000-$5,000+
- Cost of downtime avoided: $5,000-$50,000+
- Cost of compliance failure: Liability, insurance issues
- Peace of mind value: Significant
- Priority response value: Important during emergencies

**Price Based on Value Delivered:**
If avoiding one emergency per year saves $3,000-$5,000, a $3,000/year contract ($250/month) provides clear ROI.

### Competitive Pricing

**Research Market:**
- What do competitors charge?
- What's included in their contracts?
- How do you compare?
- Where can you add value?

**Differentiate on Value:**
- Don't just be cheapest
- Highlight your advantages (triple licensing, local expertise, small team responsiveness)
- Justify premium if appropriate
- Win on value, not just price

### Contract Size Factors

**Variables Affecting Price:**
- Number of facilities/properties
- Square footage
- Age of systems
- Complexity of electrical systems
- Critical systems requiring special attention
- Visit frequency (monthly vs. quarterly vs. annual)
- Response time commitments
- Geographic spread (travel time)
- After-hours coverage requirements

## Remember

**Service Contracts Build Business Stability**

Recurring revenue from service contracts provides predictable income that smooths out the ups and downs of project work.

**Customers Want Peace of Mind**

You're not selling inspections, you're selling peace of mind, compliance, and protection against costly failures.

**Deliver Exceptional Service**

Your contract performance is your best marketing. Happy contract customers refer others and expand their own contracts.

**Start Conversations Early**

Don't wait until projects are done. Introduce service contract options during project work and build the relationship.

**It's About Partnerships**

Service contracts make you a partner, not just a vendor. This relationship depth leads to more and better opportunities.
